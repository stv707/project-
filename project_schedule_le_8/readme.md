# Lesson 8 – Creating a Project Schedule  
Project+ PK0-005  
Context: Mobile App Development Project

---

## Introduction: A Schedule Is a Model, Not a Promise

A project schedule is not a calendar filled with hope.  
It is a **model of reality**, built using assumptions, constraints, and logic.

In this lesson, you will learn how a Project Manager constructs a schedule for a **mobile application project** in a way that balances structure with uncertainty.

---

## Project Context

You are the Project Manager for a **mobile fitness tracking app**.

Key constraints:
- Fixed launch window tied to a marketing campaign
- Cross-platform (iOS and Android)
- Agile delivery with 2-week sprints
- Limited development team (6 people)

The challenge is not *what* to build — it is **how to organize the work over time**.

---

## Units of Work: Thinking in Outcomes, Not Effort

Early in the project, stakeholders ask:
> “What will be done, and when?”

The PM does not answer with tasks like:
- Write code
- Fix bugs
- Attend meetings

Instead, the PM defines **units of work** in terms of **outcomes**:
- User authentication module completed
- Activity tracking feature available
- App store submission approved

This shift forces clarity:  
👉 *If an activity does not produce a measurable outcome, it does not belong in the schedule.*

---

## Milestones: Progress Without Duration

In the mobile app project, several moments matter even though they do not consume time themselves:
- Project kickoff
- Design approval
- Beta release
- App store approval
- Public launch

These are **milestones** — checkpoints, not work.

A common mistake is defining too many milestones.  
Too many approvals slow momentum; too few hide problems.

A good PM uses milestones to **create rhythm, not bureaucracy**.

---

## Sprint Goals Are Not Milestones (And Why That Matters)

The development team works in sprints, each with a sprint goal:
- “Users can create an account”
- “Workout history is visible”

Sprint goals guide the **team**, but they are not governance checkpoints.

Mixing sprint goals into the milestone list confuses **delivery planning** with **project oversight** — and weakens both.

---

## Cadence: Designing the Project’s Heartbeat

Cadence is the repeating rhythm of the project:
- Daily standups
- Sprint reviews every two weeks
- Steering committee meetings monthly

In this mobile app project:
- Fast cadences help manage uncertainty in UI and user experience
- Slower cadences reduce fatigue in reporting and governance

Cadence is not accidental.  
It is a **design decision** that shapes:
- Team energy
- Communication flow
- Burnout risk

---

## When Cadence Goes Wrong

At one point, the PM experiments with:
- Daily reporting to stakeholders

The result:
- Less development time
- More stress
- No better decisions

The lesson:  
👉 *More meetings do not equal more control.*

Cadence must support work, not compete with it.

---

## Breaking Down the Work: Seeing the Whole Before the Parts

To create the schedule, the PM builds a **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**.

Instead of asking *how* the work will be done, the PM asks:
> “What must exist when this project is complete?”

The top level looks like:
- Mobile App Delivered
- Backend Services Ready
- Compliance and Security Approved

Only after the outcomes are clear does the PM break them into smaller deliverables.

---

## Why MECE Matters in Scheduling

As the WBS grows, the PM checks:
- Is every deliverable represented once?
- Is any work missing?
- Is anything duplicated?

If two teams both think they own “User Profile Management,” the schedule will lie.

A WBS must be:
- **Mutually exclusive** (no overlap)
- **Collectively exhaustive** (nothing missing)

This discipline prevents hidden work from appearing late.

---

## Knowing When to Stop Decomposing

The PM continues breaking work down until:
- Time, cost, and resources can be estimated
- Deliverables fit within reporting periods
- Further breakdown adds no clarity

Breaking work down too far creates noise.
Not breaking it down far enough creates blind spots.

Scheduling is about **judgment**, not rules.

---

## Agile Backlogs and WBS: Choosing the Right Tool

Some teams ask:
> “Why not just use a backlog instead of a WBS?”

In this project:
- The **WBS** defines project scope and commitments
- The **product backlog** manages evolving features

They serve different purposes:
- WBS answers *“What must be delivered?”*
- Backlog answers *“What should we build next?”*

Confusing them leads to unstable schedules.

---

## Activities and Tasks: Why the PM Stays at the Right Level

Developers naturally think in tasks:
- Create API endpoint
- Write unit tests
- Fix UI alignment

The PM does not schedule these.

Why?
- Tasks change frequently
- Tasks are owned by specialists
- Tasks do not affect overall timeline directly

The schedule stays focused on **activities that move the project forward**, not every keystroke.

---

## Sequencing: The Logic Behind the Timeline

Once activities are defined, the PM determines **order**.

Some things are obvious:
- Backend APIs must exist before mobile integration testing
- App store submission must follow feature freeze

Other dependencies are choices:
- Can UI design start before backend is finalized?
- Can testing overlap with development?

Every dependency reflects a **tradeoff between speed and risk**.

---

## Mandatory vs Discretionary Dependencies

In the mobile app project:
- Security review before release is mandatory
- Waiting for a conference demo to choose a UI framework is discretionary

Mandatory dependencies cannot be negotiated.
Discretionary dependencies should be questioned.

Good PMs ask:
> “Is this dependency real, or just comfortable?”

---

## Estimation: Educated Guessing Done Honestly

Estimates are forecasts, not facts.

Early in the project, the PM uses **top-down estimates** to:
- Secure approval
- Align expectations

Later, the team uses **bottom-up estimates** to:
- Improve accuracy
- Identify risks early

The PM avoids overconfidence by reminding stakeholders:
> “Estimates are ranges, not promises.”

---

## Three Perspectives on Time

When estimating work, the PM distinguishes between:
- **Duration**: calendar time
- **Effort**: hours of work
- **Complexity**: uncertainty and risk

A feature may take:
- 3 days on the calendar
- 18 hours of effort
- High uncertainty due to new technology

Confusing these leads to unrealistic schedules.

---

## Relative Sizing: Embracing Uncertainty

For many features, exact time is unknowable.

Instead of pretending otherwise, the team estimates **relative size**:
- This feature is bigger than login
- Smaller than payment integration
- Riskier than profile editing

Relative sizing supports **learning and adaptation**, not false precision.

---

## Assigning Resources: Making the Schedule Real

A schedule without people is fiction.

The PM assigns:
- **Roles** using a responsibility matrix
- **People and equipment** using the scheduling tool

This exposes problems early:
- Overallocation
- Skill mismatches
- Unrealistic timelines

Discovering these issues during planning is success — not failure.

---

## Why Resources Are Assigned Twice

Students often ask:
> “Why assign resources in both a responsibility matrix and a schedule?”

Because they answer different questions:
- The matrix clarifies **who is accountable**
- The schedule calculates **time, cost, and availability**

Skipping either one creates blind spots.

---

## Final Reflection: Scheduling Is About Thinking, Not Tools

A project schedule is not built by software.

It is built by:
- Asking the right questions
- Challenging assumptions
- Making tradeoffs visible
- Accepting uncertainty responsibly

Tools help — but they do not replace judgment.

---

## Question to Ponder

> If your schedule looks perfect on day one,  
> what are you not seeing?

Think carefully.

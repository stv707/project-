# Lesson 8 – WBS Example  
Mobile App Development Project

---

## Context: Why This WBS Exists

This Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) represents a **realistic mobile application project** delivered using an agile approach with fixed launch constraints.

The WBS is used to:
- Define project scope
- Enable scheduling and estimation
- Support resource assignment
- Prevent hidden or duplicate work

This WBS focuses on **outcomes**, not tasks.

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Mobile Fitness Tracking App  
**Platforms:** iOS and Android  
**Delivery Model:** Agile (2-week sprints)  
**Launch Constraint:** Fixed marketing launch date

---

## WBS Design Rules Applied

- Deliverable-oriented (not task-oriented)
- Follows the **100% rule**
- **MECE** (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)
- Stops at the **work package** level
- Suitable for scheduling, estimating, and assigning resources

## Sample WBS Dictionary Entries

### Work Package: 1.2.3 – Activity Tracking Screens Available
- **Description:** Mobile UI screens allowing users to record and view fitness activities
- **Completion Criteria:** Screens implemented, reviewed, and accepted by product owner
- **Dependencies:** Backend activity service available
- **Responsible Role:** Mobile Development Team

---

### Work Package: 1.6.4 – User Acceptance Testing Completed
- **Description:** End users validate that the app meets business requirements
- **Completion Criteria:** UAT sign-off received
- **Dependencies:** Functional and performance testing completed
- **Responsible Role:** Product Owner / Business Stakeholders

---

## Why This WBS Works

- Each deliverable has a **clear “done” definition**
- No overlap between frontend, backend, and integration work
- Supports parallel execution without confusion
- Enables accurate estimation and scheduling
- Aligns with both agile delivery and Project+ expectations

---

## Reflection Questions for Students

1. Which Level 2 deliverables can be worked on in parallel?
2. Where would you stop decomposing further — and why?
3. Which work packages carry the highest risk?
4. How would this WBS change if the launch date were flexible?
5. What work is most often forgotten in mobile app projects?

---

## Key Takeaway

A WBS does not describe **how** work is done.  
It defines **what must exist** for the project to be considered complete.

Clarity creates speed.  
Ambiguity creates delay.

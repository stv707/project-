# Lesson 8 – WBS Example  
Aircraft Turnaround (20-Minute Ground Operation)

---

## Context: Why This Is a Good WBS Example

Aircraft turnaround operations are:
- Highly time-constrained
- Safety-critical
- Multi-team
- Sequential and parallel
- Zero tolerance for ambiguity

This makes them ideal for understanding **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)** design.

The goal is **not speed**, but **coordination through clarity**.

---

## Project Objective

**Project Name:** Aircraft Turnaround Operation  
**Objective:**  
Safely prepare an arriving aircraft for its next departure within **20 minutes**.

**Success Criteria:**
- Aircraft departs on schedule
- No safety incidents
- All regulatory checks completed
- Cabin and cargo ready for boarding

---

## WBS Principles Applied

This WBS:
- Is **deliverable-oriented**
- Follows the **100% Rule**
- Uses **MECE** (no overlap, nothing missing)
- Stops at the **work package** level
- Avoids tasks and micromanagement

---

## Level 1 – Aircraft Turnaround

```

1.0 Aircraft Turnaround Complete

```

---

## Level 2 – Major Deliverables

```

1.2 Passenger Handling Completed
1.3 Cabin Serviced
1.4 Cargo and Baggage Handled
1.5 Aircraft Serviced

1.5.2 Fuel replenished (if required)
1.5.3 Potable water serviced
1.5.4 Lavatory waste serviced
1.5.5 External aircraft inspection completed

```

---

### 1.6 Safety and Compliance Verified
```

1.6.1 Security sweep completed
1.6.2 Maintenance walk-around completed
1.6.3 Regulatory checks confirmed
1.6.4 Ground equipment cleared

```

---

### 1.7 Aircraft Released for Boarding
```

1.7.1 Cabin crew readiness confirmed
1.7.2 Cockpit systems checked
1.7.3 Boarding clearance issued
1.7.4 Aircraft handed over to flight crew

```

## WBS Dictionary (Sample Work Packages)

### Work Package: 1.3.4 – Lavatories Serviced
- **Description:** Clean and replenish all aircraft lavatories
- **Inputs:** Cleaning supplies, ground crew access
- **Completion Criteria:** All lavatories clean, stocked, and operational
- **Constraints:** Must be completed before final cabin inspection
- **Responsible Team:** Cabin Services

---

### Work Package: 1.4.6 – Cargo Hold Secured
- **Description:** Ensure cargo doors are closed, locked, and verified
- **Completion Criteria:** Door status confirmed and logged
- **Dependencies:** Cargo loading completed
- **Responsible Team:** Ground Operations

---

## Why This WBS Works

- No activities overlap
- Every team knows **what “done” means**
- Parallel work is possible without confusion
- Time pressure is managed through structure, not heroics

This WBS allows scheduling, sequencing, and resource assignment **without guessing**.

---

## Reflection Questions for Students

1. Which Level 2 deliverables can occur in parallel?
2. What would happen if “Safety and Compliance Verified” was skipped?
3. Where would you stop decomposing further — and why?
4. Which work packages are most critical in a 20-minute window?
5. How would this WBS change for a long-haul aircraft?

---

## Key Lesson

A good WBS does not describe **how fast** work happens.  
It describes **what must exist** before work is considered complete.

Speed comes from clarity.

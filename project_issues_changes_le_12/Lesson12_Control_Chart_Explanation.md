# Lesson 12 – Control Chart (Monitoring Issues)
**Project+ (PK0-005) | Topic 12A – Resolve Issues**

---

## Project Context

**Project:** Customer Analytics Dashboard  
**Environment:** CI/CD Pipeline  
**Metric:** Build Time (minutes)

The project manager is monitoring whether the software delivery process remains stable after issue resolution.

---

## Why Control Charts Are Used

Control charts are used during **Monitor the Issue** to answer:

> “Is the process stable, or has something changed?”

---

## Understanding the Chart

- **CL (Center Line):** Average build time
- **UCL:** Upper expected limit
- **LCL:** Lower expected limit

These are statistical limits, not targets.

---

## Interpreting the Data

- Most data points fall between UCL and LCL → normal variation
- One data point exceeds UCL → special cause variation

This indicates an abnormal event that requires investigation.

---

## PM Actions

- Investigate special cause events
- Avoid reacting to normal variation
- Confirm stability after corrective action

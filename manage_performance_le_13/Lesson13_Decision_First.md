# Lesson 13 – Performance Measurement (Decision‑First)
**Project+ (PK0‑005)**

---

## Why Lesson 13 Exists
Lesson 13 teaches how a PM decides if a project is healthy.

This is not a math lesson.
This is a decision lesson.

---

## Step 1: Ask the Question

| Question | Metric |
|---|---|
| Spending OK? | EV vs AC |
| On schedule? | EV vs PV |
| End result? | EAC / VAC |

---

## Step 2: Interpret First
- EV < AC → cost problem
- EV < PV → schedule problem

---

## Step 3: Confirm with Metrics
- CV / SV show direction
- CPI / SPI show efficiency

---

## Step 4: Forecast
EAC and VAC answer:
"If nothing changes, where will we land?"

---

## Exam Focus
- Understand meaning
- Not heavy calculation
- PM interprets, tools calculate

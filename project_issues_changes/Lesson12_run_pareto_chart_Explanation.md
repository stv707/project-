# Lesson 12 – Run Chart & Pareto Chart Explained  
**Project+ (PK0-005) | Topic 12A – Resolve Issues**  
**Slides 15–19**

---

## Project Context

**Project:** Customer Analytics Dashboard  
**Phase:** Mid-project execution  
**Problem:** Multiple issues are affecting delivery and quality  

The Project Manager needs to:
1. Understand how issues are behaving over time
2. Decide which issues should be addressed first

This is where **Run Charts** and **Pareto Charts** are used.

---

## Part 1: Run Chart (Slides 15–17)

### What Question Does a Run Chart Answer?

> **“Are issues improving or getting worse over time?”**

A Run Chart is about **trend**, not root cause and not prioritization.

---

### Data Used in This Chart

- **X-axis:** Time (Weeks)
- **Y-axis:** Number of open issues
- Each data point represents the total number of open issues at the end of a week

---

### How to Read the Run Chart

- The issue count fluctuates initially
- Over time, the overall direction trends downward
- This indicates that issue resolution actions are having a positive effect

---

### What a Run Chart Tells the PM

- Whether corrective actions are working
- Whether the situation is improving, worsening, or stagnant
- Whether new issues are appearing faster than they are resolved

---

### What a Run Chart Does *Not* Tell the PM

- It does NOT identify the root cause
- It does NOT show which issue is most important
- It does NOT define acceptable limits

---

### Exam Tip (Very Important)

> **Run charts are used to monitor trends over time.**  
They are NOT control charts and have no upper or lower limits.

---

## Part 2: Pareto Chart (Slides 18–19)

### What Question Does a Pareto Chart Answer?

> **“Which issues create most of the project’s problems?”**

A Pareto Chart is a **prioritization tool**, not a trend tool.

---

### Data Used in This Chart

| Issue Category | Number of Issues | % of Total | Cumulative % |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Unclear Requirements | 16 | 38.10% | 38.10% |
| Unplanned Operational Work | 12 | 28.57% | 66.67% |
| Cross-Team Dependencies | 7 | 16.67% | 83.33% |
| Environment Issues | 4 | 9.52% | 92.86% |
| Resource Availability | 3 | 7.14% | 100% |

Total issues = **42**

---

### Why Percentages Are Used

The **bars** show how often each issue occurs.

The **percentage and cumulative percentage** show:
> **How much of the total problem is explained so far**

This allows the PM to measure **impact**, not just frequency.

---

### How to Read the Pareto Chart

- The bars are sorted from highest to lowest frequency
- The green line shows the **cumulative percentage**
- As the PM moves left to right, they can see how quickly impact accumulates

---

### The Key Insight from This Chart

By addressing only:
- **Unclear Requirements**
- **Unplanned Operational Work**

The PM can potentially address:
> **66.67% of all project issues**

Including **Cross-Team Dependencies** raises this to:
> **83.33% of all issues**

This is the **Pareto (80/20) effect**.

---

### Why This Matters to a Project Manager

- Time, budget, and people are limited
- Not all issues deserve equal attention
- Fixing low-impact issues first wastes resources

Pareto helps the PM:
- Focus effort where it delivers the most benefit
- Justify prioritization decisions to stakeholders
- Avoid emotional or politically driven decisions

---

### What a Pareto Chart Does *Not* Do

- It does NOT identify root cause
- It does NOT show trends over time
- It does NOT replace Root Cause Analysis tools

---

### Exam Tip (Critical)

> **Pareto charts are used to identify priorities using the 80/20 rule.**

The PM should always address the **highest-impact categories first**, not the easiest or loudest issues.

---

## Run Chart vs Pareto Chart (Slide Summary)

| Tool | Primary Purpose |
|---|---|
| Run Chart | Monitor trends over time |
| Pareto Chart | Prioritize issues by impact |

They are used together:
1. **Run Chart** → Are we improving?
2. **Pareto Chart** → Where should we focus next?

---

## Key Takeaways (Project+ Focus)

- Run charts show **direction**
- Pareto charts show **priority**
- Percentages exist to show **impact accumulation**
- Neither tool identifies root cause by itself
- Both support better issue management decisions

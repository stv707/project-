Project+ Exam PK0-005

---

## 1. Overview

Resource management ensures that the **right people, tools, and budget** are available **at the right time** to complete a project successfully.

In software projects, poor resource management often causes:
- Schedule slippage
- Burnout
- Cost overruns
- Quality degradation

---

## 2. Types of Resources

### Human Resources
People working on the project.

**Software Example:**
- Backend developers
- Frontend developers
- QA testers
- DevOps engineers

---

### Physical Resources
Tangible items needed to complete work.

**Software Example:**
- Laptops
- Servers
- Test devices (mobile phones, tablets)
- Network equipment

---

### Capital Resources
Financial resources used to acquire other resources.

**Software Example:**
- Cloud service subscription (AWS, Azure)
- Software licenses
- Contractor payments

---

## 3. Resource Sourcing Methods

### Internal Resources
Resources already within the organization.

**Pros:**
- Lower cost
- Familiar with systems
- Fewer unknowns

**Cons:**
- Limited availability

**Example:**
An in-house developer is assigned part-time to a new microservices project.

---

### External Resources
Resources acquired outside the organization.

**Pros:**
- High availability
- Specialized skills

**Cons:**
- Higher cost
- Requires procurement

**Example:**
Hiring a freelance UX designer for a mobile app redesign.

---

## 4. Resource Allocation Methods

### Shared Resources
Resources assigned to multiple projects.

**Characteristics:**
- Requires coordination
- Common in matrix organizations

**Example:**
A DevOps engineer supporting three different application teams.

---

### Dedicated Resources
Resources assigned exclusively to one project.

**Characteristics:**
- Fewer scheduling conflicts
- Higher cost
- Best for high-priority projects

**Example:**
A full-time Scrum Master assigned only to a cloud migration project.

---

## 5. Resource Life Cycle

Resources move through four phases:

### Acquisition
- Needs assessment
- Recruiting
- Procurement

**Example:**
Hiring a backend developer after identifying a skills gap.

---

### Maintenance and Monitoring
- Performance reviews
- System updates
- Dashboards

**Example:**
Monitoring developer workload and server utilization.

---

### Improvement
- Training
- Process improvements
- Feature enhancements

**Example:**
Training developers on Kubernetes to improve deployment efficiency.

---

### Retirement
- Software end-of-life (EOL)
- Hardware decommissioning
- Succession planning

**Example:**
Retiring a legacy Java framework that is no longer supported.

---

## 6. Needs Assessment

A needs assessment identifies what resources are required to solve a business problem.

### Benefits
- Early problem identification
- Reduced project risks
- Improved on-time delivery

**Software Example:**
Identifying the need for an additional QA tester before entering system testing.

---

## 7. Needs Assessment Process

1. Understand project requirements
2. Identify current resources
3. Identify resource gaps
4. Address the gaps

**Example Outcome:**
- Skills gap → Training
- Software gap → Purchase license
- People gap → Hire contractor

---

## 8. Gap Analysis

Gap analysis compares the **current state** to the **desired future state**.

### Skill Gaps
**Example:**
- Current: Developer is proficient in Java
- Future: Requires expert-level Spring Boot
- Action: Provide training or mentorship

---

### Feature vs Function Gaps

- **Feature:** What the software does
- **Function:** How the software operates internally

**Example:**
- Feature gap: No group chat support
- Function gap: Chat works internally but not externally

---

## 9. Resource Utilization

Resource utilization measures efficiency.

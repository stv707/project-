# Lesson 7 – Managing Risk  
Project+ PK0-005  
Context: Mobile App Development Project

## Introduction: Why Risk Is Not the Enemy

In project management, risk is often misunderstood as something negative that must be avoided at all costs.  
In reality, **risk is simply uncertainty** — and uncertainty is unavoidable in software projects.

This lesson explores how a Project Manager thinks about, identifies, analyzes, and responds to risk during the development of a **mobile application**.

---

## Project Context

Imagine you are the Project Manager for a **mobile food delivery app** scheduled to launch in 6 months.

Key characteristics:
- iOS and Android platforms
- Integration with payment gateways
- External vendor for maps and location services
- Fixed marketing launch date

From day one, this project is full of uncertainty — which means **risk already exists**, whether you acknowledge it or not.

---

## Risk vs Issue vs Change (Think Carefully)

Early in the project, the team discusses the possibility that:
> “Apple might reject our app due to new App Store review guidelines.”

This is a **risk** — it *might* happen.

Three months later, Apple updates its guidelines and formally rejects your app submission.

Now it is no longer a risk.  
It is an **issue**.

To address the rejection, you decide to:
- Remove a feature
- Redesign the onboarding flow
- Extend the schedule by two weeks

That decision is a **change**.

👉 A good PM understands that **risks, issues, and changes are connected**, not isolated concepts.

---

## Positive Risk: The One Most PMs Ignore

During development, your cloud provider announces:
> “A new managed push-notification service will be released next month.”

If adopted, it could:
- Reduce development time
- Improve reliability
- Lower operational cost

This is also a **risk** — but a **positive one**.

A weak PM ignores it because “it’s not in the plan.”  
A strong PM evaluates whether exploiting this opportunity improves project outcomes **without increasing other risks**.

---

## The Risk Management Mindset

Risk management is not about predicting the future perfectly.

It is about:
- Increasing **known risks**
- Reducing **unknown risks**

In the mobile app project, unknown risks include:
- Undocumented API limitations
- Unclear regulatory requirements
- Hidden dependencies between features

Every conversation, prototype, and technical spike turns unknown risk into known risk.

---

## Risk Ownership Matters

During a planning meeting, the team identifies a risk:
> “The payment gateway may not support certain local banks.”

If everyone owns this risk, **nobody owns it**.

A mature PM assigns a **risk owner**:
- A specific person
- Responsible for monitoring, analysis, and response planning

Risk ownership creates **accountability**, not blame.

---

## Identifying Risks: Look Inward and Outward

### Internal Risks (Within Your Control)
- New team members unfamiliar with mobile frameworks
- Unrealistic sprint commitments
- Poor communication between frontend and backend teams

### External Risks (Outside Your Control)
- App Store policy changes
- Regulatory changes (e.g. data privacy laws)
- Vendor outages
- Cybersecurity incidents

Good PMs don’t complain about external risks — they **plan for them**.

---

## Qualitative Risk Analysis: Prioritization Before Precision

Early in the project, the PM gathers the team and asks:
> “Which risks should keep us awake at night?”

The answers are subjective, based on experience:
- “Payment failures would kill user trust.”
- “Late UI changes will hurt testing.”

This is **qualitative analysis** — fast, human, and essential.

Trying to calculate numbers too early creates **false confidence**.

---

## Detectability: The Silent Risk Multiplier

Some risks are dangerous not because they are severe, but because they are **hard to detect**.

Example:
- A memory leak in the mobile app that only appears after long usage
- A security flaw that is invisible until exploited

Low detectability means:
- The project may appear healthy
- Until damage is already done

Smart PMs invest in:
- Monitoring
- Logging
- Early warning signals

---

## Quantitative Thinking (When It Actually Helps)

Later in the project, leadership asks:
> “What is the cost impact if launch is delayed by two weeks?”

Now numbers matter.

The PM uses data to estimate:
- Additional development cost
- Lost marketing momentum
- Contract penalties

Quantitative analysis **supports decisions**, but it does not replace judgment.

---

## Probability and Impact: A Thinking Tool, Not a Formula

Not all risks deserve equal attention.

Ask yourself:
- How likely is this risk?
- If it happens, how bad is it?

A rare but catastrophic risk (e.g. payment data breach) deserves more attention than a frequent but minor UI bug.

The goal is **focus**, not mathematical perfection.

---

## Scenario Analysis: Asking “What If?”

Good PMs regularly ask:
- What if the launch date cannot move?
- What if a key developer resigns?
- What if user adoption exceeds expectations?

Scenario analysis prepares the mind **before reality forces a reaction**.

---

## Risk Response Strategies in Real Life

When facing a risk, a PM has options:

- **Avoid**: Remove a risky feature entirely
- **Mitigate**: Reduce likelihood or impact
- **Transfer**: Use insurance or vendor contracts
- **Accept**: Acknowledge and monitor
- **Exploit**: Actively pursue positive risk

There is no “best” strategy — only **appropriate choices**.

---

## Mitigation vs Contingency: Don’t Confuse Them

- **Mitigation** happens *before* the risk occurs  
  Example: Adding extra testing to reduce defect risk

- **Contingency** happens *after* the risk occurs  
  Example: Rolling back to a previous app version

Confusing the two leads to panic when things go wrong.

---

## The Risk Register Is a Living Document

The risk register is not paperwork.

It is a **decision-support tool** that answers:
- What could go wrong?
- Who owns it?
- What are we doing about it?

If it’s not updated, it’s lying.

---

## Planning for Transition: The Risk After Delivery

Many projects fail **after go-live**, not before.

Risks during transition include:
- Operations team unprepared
- Missing documentation
- No ownership handover

A responsible PM plans risk **beyond delivery**, not just until launch.

---

## Final Reflection for Students

Managing risk is not about fear.

It is about:
- Awareness
- Responsibility
- Decision-making under uncertainty

A Project Manager who ignores risk is gambling with other people’s time, money, and trust.

That is not leadership.

## Question to Ponder

> If your mobile app launches on time but collapses under real users,  
> did you succeed — or just delay failure?

Think carefully.
